i have developed a demo with a model which detect enough with a accuracy of 87% for detecting racket, 71% for detecting shuttle ,94% for detecting net , 90% for detecting human,50-60% if it is fault, and made an interface with tkinter, where we can upload a video and will give a output , this is the progress , so now i need to improve the model and need to try more datasets iterations, and better hardware as of now rtx3050 is limiting me , so have to make more improvements
